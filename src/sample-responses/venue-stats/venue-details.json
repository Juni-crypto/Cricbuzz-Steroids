The stadium gets its name from its location. It is in the vicinity of the Feroz Shah Kotla, a fortress built by Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq. Having been established in 1883, the ground has undergone some heavy reconstruction over the years. Colloquially, the locals also call the stadium 'Kotla', which literally means citadel or fortress. The first international game here was a Test match between India and the West Indies in 1948.\n\nThe Feroz Shah Kotla has been a very happy hunting ground for the Indian cricket team. India won 7 successive Tests between 1993-2007. In fact, India have won 9 and drawn 1 of their last 10 Tests here. India last lost a Test match here way back in 1987, a game that saw India getting bowled out for 75 in the first innings. India's ODI record at this stadium isn't bad either. Since April 2005, they have won 6 games here and lost none; one game was cancelled and one was a no result. Their last ODI defeat at Kotla came against Pakistan, where the visitors won by a margin of 159 runs. The win helped Pakistan win the ODI series 4-2 after India had taken a 2-0 lead previously.\n\n<b>How does the pitch play</b>?\n\nOver the years, the pitch at Feroz Shah Kotla has largely been batting friendly. However, in December 2009, the Kotla pitch came under severe criticism after an ODI between India and Sri Lanka had to be called off. The pitch was deemed unfit and dangerous after instances of atrocious uneven bounce off the pitch. Sri Lanka were 83 for 5 when the match officials decided that the game couldn't be continued further, owing to players' safety.\n\nBased on the match referee's report on the game, the stadium was in danger of getting banned for a period of 1-2 years. A ban of more than 14 months would have seen the stadium lose out on hosting any games during the 2011 World Cup. However, the ICC decided to ban it for just 12 months, paving the way for Kotla to stage its share of 4 World Cup games, including India's game against the Netherlands.\n\n<b>Interesting Records at Feroz Shah Kotla</b>:\n\nThe stadium witnessed Anil Kumble's famous 10/74 in an innings, against Pakistan in 1999. With these figures, Kumble became only the second bowler after Jim Laker to take all the ten wickets in an innings.\n\nIn 1983, Sunil Gavaskar scored his 29th Test ton at this venue, equalling Sir Donald Bradman's record for the most number of centuries in Test cricket.\n\nIn 2005, Sachin Tendulkar went past Sunil Gavaskar's record of 34 Test centuries, registering his 35th Test ton in the second Test against Sri Lanka at this venue.\n\nBy <b>Sidhant Maheshwari</b>",
